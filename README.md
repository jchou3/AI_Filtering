Intro AI Assignment 2, Filtering in Dynamic Bayesian Networks

World files are held in worlds folder.
Path files are held in paths folder.

To run the program, first make sure that the world and path files being used are in their respective folders. Run main.py and input the world file name (i.e. "world0.txt") and path file name ("path0_0.txt") when prompted. Enter also how fast you would like the visualization of each step to last in seconds (i.e. ".5", "1") when prompted. The visualization will appear as a heatmap on a matplotlib grid. Probabilities can be seen by hovering over the corresponding coordinate. 

Note that the matplotlib grid numbers off of line coordinates while the world and heatmap follow cell coordinates. For example, cell y = 5, x = 10 will appear as y = 4.5 - 5.5, x = 9.5 - 10.5. 

The ground truth of the agent's position is indicated by a blue dot.
